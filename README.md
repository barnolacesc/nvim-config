## Installation

All plugins are installed using `lazy.nvim`, a fast and efficient plugin manager for Neovim. Make sure to install `lazy.nvim` first and then use the setup configuration provided for these plugins.

## Usage

Each plugin provides its functionality immediately after installation and configuration.

It is arranged in a way that there is the `lua/plugins` folder that holds the instalation and configuration of each plugin.
The plugins are automatically installed when the file is created properly.

For detailed usage instructions, refer to each pluginâ€™s documentation.

This configuration can work and has been tested in both MacOs Sequoia 15.1.1 and Windows 11.
